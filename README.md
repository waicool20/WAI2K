# Setup

Prerequisites:

* [Java JDK 8 ( Get the Full Version! )](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-8u252/)
* [Assets Directory](https://github.com/waicool20/WAI2K/tree/master/assets)
* Emulator, must be 2160x1080 resolution

Currently this project does not release under github due to the WIP nature. However you can find per-commit
ready to use app on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/waicool20/wai2k) under the artifacts tab

Start the app by running the jar file (Double click on windows)

A new folder called `wai2k` will be generated beside the app, this is your configuration directory.
Take the assets directory downloaded above and place it inside.

You will also be prompted to download some extra files into `wai2k/tessdata`

All in all your final configuration directory should look like this:  
![Config Directory](screenshots/config-dir.png?raw=true)

It is recommended to use the Android Studio Emulator to run the game.

There is a certain difficulty in setting up the script due to the specificity that the script requires in the environment it runs in
which is understandable, hopefully the articles below can help you.

# Build Instructions

Prerequisites: 

* [Java JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [My Utility Library](https://github.com/waicool20/waicoolUtils), place this inside the project directory, you don't need to do this if you are cloning and pulling all submodules
* [CVAuto](https://github.com/waicool20/CVAuto), same as the utility library above

Git clone instructions: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waicool20/WAI2K.git     // Clone repository, replace with ssh url if you prefer that  
cd WAI2K/                                            // Make sure you are in the WAI2K directory
git submodule update --init --recursive             // Pull all submodules, this includes the utility library and cvauto
```

To build the jar file after cloning/pulling the latest commits, go into the repo directory and run the right command

Windows:

> gradlew.bat

Linux/MacOS:

> ./gradlew

A compiled Jar file which you can execute directly will be generated in the build/libs directory
